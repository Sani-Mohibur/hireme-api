# HireMe - Job Posting Platform Backend

A robust backend system for **HireMe**, a job portal where companies can post jobs and job seekers can apply by uploading their CVs and making a payment. This system is built with **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, featuring role-based access control (RBAC).

## 🚀 Features

  * **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure JWT authentication for Admins, Employees (Recruiters), and Job Seekers.
  * **Job Management:** Recruiters can post, edit, and delete their own jobs. Admins have global access.
  * **Application System:** Job Seekers can apply for jobs by uploading a CV (PDF/DOCX).
  * **Mock Payment Integration:** Simulates a payment of **100 Taka** required to submit an application.
  * **File Upload:** Secure handling of resume uploads using `Multer`.
  * **Admin Dashboard:** APIs for viewing system stats, managing users, and monitoring all applications.
  * **Input Validation:** Strict data validation using **Zod** to ensure data integrity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

  * **Language:** TypeScript
  * **Runtime:** Node.js
  * **Framework:** Express.js
  * **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
  * **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & BcryptJS
  * **Validation:** Mongoose & Native Checks
  * **File Handling:** Multer
  * **Validation:** Zod

## 💳 Payment Flow (Mock)

Since real payment gateway integration requires verified merchant accounts, this system uses a **Mock Payment Implementation**:

1.  When a **Job Seeker** hits the apply endpoint (`POST /api/applications/:jobId`), the backend simulates a payment process.
2.  The system internally generates a **Transaction ID** (e.g., `TXN_1723456789_123`).
3.  It assigns a payment amount of **100 Taka** and marks the status as `PAID`.
4.  This payment record is embedded into the Application document in MongoDB.

-----

## 📂 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The system consists of three main entities: **USER**, **JOB**, and **APPLICATION**.  

- **USER**: Represents Admins, Employees (Recruiters), and Job Seekers.  
- **JOB**: Represents jobs posted by Employees (Recruiters).  
- **APPLICATION**: Represents job applications submitted by Job Seekers, including resume uploads and payment details.

### Relationships

- **USER → JOB**: One-to-Many (a Recruiter can post multiple jobs).  
- **USER → APPLICATION**: One-to-Many (a Job Seeker can submit multiple applications).  
- **JOB → APPLICATION**: One-to-Many (a job can receive multiple applications).

## 🧪 Testing & API Documentation

You can verify all endpoints using the published Postman Documentation.

**🔗 [View Postman Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/46560325/2sB3dQupTi)**

### How to Test Locally
1.  Ensure the server is running (`npm run dev`).
2.  Open the Postman link above.
3.  **Register** users with different roles (`ADMIN`, `EMPLOYEE`, `JOB_SEEKER`) to test the specific permissions for each route.
   
***Note:** When testing the **Apply for Job** endpoint as a *Seeker*, the system will automatically simulate a successful payment and generate a transaction ID.*
